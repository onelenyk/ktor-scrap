# Project Plan

This document outlines the final steps to prepare the ktor-scrap project for a public release.

### Completed Tasks

-   **Full Feature Implementation:** The core scraping functionality, Firestore migration, and a comprehensive web UI have been completed.
-   **Code Stabilization:** The codebase has been refactored, tested, and cleaned up.
-   **UI/UX Enhancements:** The web UI has been significantly improved with a modern design, better user feedback, and advanced features like job grouping and restarting.

### Next Steps

1.  **Final Polish:** Perform a final review of the entire codebase to ensure consistency, remove any remaining dead code, and add comments where necessary.
2.  **Update Documentation:** Rewrite the `README.md` file to accurately reflect the project's current state. The new documentation should include:
    -   A clear and concise project description.
    -   A list of current features.
    -   An overview of the project's architecture.
    -   Detailed instructions for setup and configuration (including Firestore credentials).
    -   Instructions on how to run and use the application.
