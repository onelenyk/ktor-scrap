# Project-Specific Rules

1.  **Primary Database:** The primary database is Firestore. All new data-related features should use Firestore.
2.  **Code Style:** Adhere strictly to the existing Kotlin coding conventions and the style enforced by ktlint.
3.  **Testing:** While temporarily disabled, the goal is to have comprehensive test coverage. All new features should eventually be accompanied by tests.
